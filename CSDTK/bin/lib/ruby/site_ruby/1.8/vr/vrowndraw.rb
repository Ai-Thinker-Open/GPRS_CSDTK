Owner draw button.
This is just a button but the system doesn't draw button faces.
It's necessary to draw button face manually.

=== Required methods
In these method, it doesn't need to call ((*dopaint*)).

--- drawpushed(left,top,right,bottom,state)
    Draws the pushed button face.
--- drawreleased(left,top,right,bottom,state)
    Draws the released button face.
--- drawfocused(left,top,right,bottom,state)
    Draws the focused button face. 
    This method is fired after drawpushed or drawreleased.
