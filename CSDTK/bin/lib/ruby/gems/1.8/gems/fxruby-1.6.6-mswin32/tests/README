This is the test suite for FXRuby (obviously still under development). It's
mainly intended for use by Lyle to test new releases of FXRuby, but if you'd
like to run the test suite yourself you will need to have installed a recent
version of TestUnit, available here:

    http://testunit.talbott.ws

Each of the test cases has a file name of the form "TC_classname.rb". To run a
particular test case, just type:

    ruby TC_classname.rb

and scan the results for any failures. To run the entire suite of test cases,
type:

    ruby TS_All.rb

If you notice any failures in a (public) release of FXRuby, please notify
Lyle. He wouldn't intentionally have let it go ;)
