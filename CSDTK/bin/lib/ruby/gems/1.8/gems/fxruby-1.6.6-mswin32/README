This is FXRuby, the Ruby language bindings for the FOX GUI toolkit. For
instructions on building FXRuby from the source code, please see the build
instructions from the FXRuby User's Guide:

	doc/build.html

The directory structure is:

    doc/
	Contains the documentation (a.k.a. the FXRuby User's Guide) in
	HTML format.
    examples/
        Contains example programs demonstrating how to use FXRuby and
        its many wonderful features.
    ext/fox12
        Contains the C++ source code for the shared library part of FXRuby.
	These files are required to build FXRuby from the source code.
    lib/fox12
        Contains the Ruby source code for the rest of FXRuby. These files
        are not required to "build" FXRuby, but they are a part of the
	standard FXRuby runtime environment and must be installed along with
	the shared library part.
    tests/
	Contains the beginnings of a test battery for FXRuby. Not much to
	see here.

If you're looking at a checkout of the source code from its CVS repository,
you might see some additional directories of interest:

    fox-includes/
	An archive of the FOX library header files corresponding to this
	release of FXRuby.
    rdoc-sources/
	The beginnings of a set of "fake" Ruby source files for the various
	FXRuby classes, which are used to generate RDoc-style documentation.
	Not quite ready for prime time, but should be soon.
    swig-interfaces/
	The SWIG interface files used to generate the C++ wrapper code (i.e.
	the code found in the ext/fox directory).
