    consisting of a main window widget (a <code class="classname">DragSource</code>
    instance) that parents an <code class="classname">FXCanvas</code> widget:</p><pre class="programlisting">require 'rubygems'
require_gem 'fxruby'

include Fox

class DragSource &lt; FXMainWindow
  def initialize(anApp)
    # Initialize base class
    super(anApp, "Drag Source", nil, nil, DECOR_ALL, 0, 0, 400, 300)
    
    # Fill main window with canvas
    @canvas = FXCanvas.new(self, nil, 0, LAYOUT_FILL_X|LAYOUT_FILL_Y)
    @canvas.backColor = "red"
    
    # Handle expose events on the canvas
    @canvas.connect(SEL_PAINT) { |sender, sel, event|
      FXDCWindow.new(@canvas, event) { |dc|
        dc.foreground = @canvas.backColor
        dc.fillRectangle(event.rect.x, event.rect.y, event.rect.w, event.rect.h)
      }
    }
  end

  def create
    # Create the main window and canvas
    super
    
    # Register the drag type for colors
    FXWindow.colorType = getApp().registerDragType(FXWindow.colorTypeName)

    # Show the main window
    show(PLACEMENT_SCREEN)
  end
end

if __FILE__ == $0
  FXApp.new("DragSource", "FXRuby") do |theApp|
    DragSource.new(theApp)
    theApp.create
    theApp.run
  end
end

</pre><p>Since the main program (i.e. the part at the end) won't change for
    the rest of the tutorial, I won't show that code anymore. Furthermore, the
    <code class="classname">DragSource</code> class has a few things in common with
    the <code class="classname">DropSite</code> class from the previous example,
    namely:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>We've defined a <code class="constant">SEL_PAINT</code> handler for the
        canvas widget that just clears the canvas to its current background
        color; and,</p></li><li><p>The drag type for colors
        (<code class="constant">FXWindow.colorType</code>) is registered in the
        <code class="classname">DragSource</code>'s <code class="methodname">create()</code>
        method.</p></li></ul></div><p>As before, you may want to run this basic version of the program to
    be sure that it's working properly so far. You should simply see an empty
    window with a red background.</p><p>Now for this application, we want a drag operation to begin when the
    user presses the left mouse button inside the canvas and starts "dragging"
    away from the canvas. So the first change we need to make is to add a
    handler for the <code class="constant">SEL_LEFTBUTTONPRESS</code> message from the
    canvas:</p><pre class="programlisting">@canvas.connect(SEL_LEFTBUTTONPRESS) {
  #
  # Capture (grab) the mouse when the button goes down, so that all future
  # mouse events will be reported to this widget, even if those events occur
  # outside of this widget.
  #
  @canvas.grab

  # Advertise which drag types we can offer
  dragTypes = [FXWindow.colorType]
  @canvas.beginDrag(dragTypes)
}
</pre><p>Note that there are usually two things you're going to want to do in
    the <code class="constant">SEL_LEFTBUTTONPRESS</code> handler for a drag source.
    The first is to call <code class="methodname">grab()</code> on the window that
    acts as the drag source. Calling <code class="methodname">grab()</code>
    "captures" the mouse in the sense that subsequent mouse motion events will
    be reported as if they occurred inside the grab window. This is important,
    since in our case we're going to be dragging from this window to some
    other window, possibly a window in a different application
    altogether.</p><p>The second thing you'll want to do in the
    <code class="constant">SEL_LEFTBUTTONPRESS</code> handler for a drag source is to
    call <code class="methodname">beginDrag()</code>. This not only kicks the
    application into drag-and-drop mode, but also provides a way for you to
    inform the system about the formats of data (i.e. the drag types) that
    this drag source is able to provide. For this example, the drag source is
    just going to offer one drag type.</p><p>Since releasing the left mouse button should end the drag operation,
    it's important to also add a handler for the
    <code class="constant">SEL_LEFTBUTTONRELEASE</code> message:</p><pre class="programlisting">@canvas.connect(SEL_LEFTBUTTONRELEASE) {
  @canvas.ungrab
  @canvas.endDrag
}
</pre><p>This is pretty much the mirror image of our
    <code class="constant">SEL_LEFTBUTTONPRESS</code> handler. We call
    <code class="methodname">ungrab()</code> to release the mouse capture, and
    <code class="methodname">endDrag()</code> to clean up the drag-and-drop
    state.</p><p>The next change is to add a <code class="constant">SEL_MOTION</code> handler,
    to handle mouse motion events during the drag operation:</p><pre class="programlisting">@canvas.connect(SEL_MOTION) { |sender, sel, event|
  if @canvas.dragging?
    @canvas.handleDrag(event.root_x, event.root_y)
    unless @canvas.didAccept == DRAG_REJECT
      @canvas.dragCursor = getApp().getDefaultCursor(DEF_SWATCH_CURSOR)
    else
      @canvas.dragCursor = getApp().getDefaultCursor(DEF_DNDSTOP_CURSOR)
    end
  end
}
</pre><p>The <code class="methodname">dragging?</code> method returns true if we're
    in the middle of a drag-and-drop operation for the drag source window,
    i.e. after the call to <code class="methodname">beginDrag()</code> but before the
    call to <code class="methodname">endDrag()</code>. If we're not currently
    processing a drag operation, we're not really interested in mouse motion
    events for the canvas.</p><p>If we <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> processing a drag operation, however,
    we need to call <code class="methodname">handleDrag()</code> on the drag source
    window. FOX uses this information to send drag-and-drop messages (such as
    <code class="constant">SEL_DND_ENTER</code>, <code class="constant">SEL_DND_MOTION</code>
    and <code class="constant">SEL_DND_LEAVE</code>) to the window that the mouse is
    currently over. Note that the coordinates passed to
    <code class="methodname">handleDrag()</code> are root window coordinates, and not
    window-local coordinates.</p><p>Another good thing to consider doing here is to change the shape of
    the cursor depending on the drop site's response to the drag-and-drop
    messages from the drag source. For this example, we change the drag cursor
    to one of FOX's built-in cursor shapes
    (<code class="constant">DEF_SWATCH_CURSOR</code>) if we get any response other than
    <code class="constant">DRAG_REJECT</code> from the drop site. If the drop site
    rejects this drag source's overtures, we instead change the drag cursor to
    a cursor that resembles a stop sign
    (<code class="constant">DEF_DNDSTOP_CURSOR</code>).</p><p>I've purposely avoided suggesting that you run the program for the
    last couple of changes, since until now there wasn't going to be any
    visual indication that anything interesting was happening. But now you
    should be able to run the application in its current state and see a few
    things.</p><p>A first test is to confirm that the cursor shape changes to the
    "stop" sign when you attempt to drag over some window that isn't willing
    to accept a drop of the <code class="constant">FXWindow.colorType</code> drag type.
    Start up one of the other FXRuby example programs (such as the
    <code class="filename">scribble.rb</code> example) alongside your drag source
    program, and then try "dragging" from the drag source's canvas onto the
    Scribble program's canvas. During the drag attempt, the cursor should
    maintain its shape as a "stop" sign since the canvas in the
    <code class="filename">scribble.rb</code> example isn't drop-enabled.</p><p>Your next test can confirm that the cursor shape changes to the
    "swatch" cursor (a small square) when you attempt to drag over a window
    that is drop-enabled, and which is willing to accepts drops of this drag
    type. The obvious choice is the example from the previous section (the
    dropsite.rb program), but you should have success with any FXRuby example
    program that displays color wells. Start up one of these drop-enabled
    programs alongside your drag source program, and then try "dragging" from
    the drag source's canvas onto the drop site. While the mouse pointer is
    over a drop-enabled window, the cursor should change its shape.</p><p>The last (and most important) step is to actually complete the data
    transfer. At any time during a drag-and-drop operation, a drop site may
    request a copy of the drag-and-drop data by calling the
    <code class="methodname">getDNDData()</code> method (as described in the previous
    section). When this happens, FOX sends a
    <code class="constant">SEL_DND_REQUEST</code> message to the current drag source
    window, and so we now add a handler for that message:</p><pre class="programlisting">@canvas.connect(SEL_DND_REQUEST) { |sender, sel, event|
  if event.target == FXWindow.colorType
    @canvas.setDNDData(FROM_DRAGNDROP, FXWindow.colorType, Fox.fxencodeColorData(@canvas.backColor))
  end
}
</pre><p>The first important thing to note here is that the
    <code class="varname">target</code> field of the <code class="classname">FXEvent</code>
    instance will contain the drag type requested by the drop site. If your
    drag source offers its data in multiple formats, you definitely need to
    check this in order to know how to package-up the data for transfer.
    However, even if you're only offering the data in a single format (as in
    this example) it's still a good idea to check the requested type, since a
    rogue drop site could ask for the data in some unexpected format.</p><p>Assuming that the drag type is as expected, the last step is send
    the data to the drop site by calling
    <code class="methodname">setDNDData()</code>. As with the call to
    <code class="methodname">getDNDData()</code> for our previous drop site program,
    you want to be sure to specify the origin of the data
    (<code class="constant">FROM_DRAGNDROP</code>), the drag type
    (<code class="constant">FXWindow.colorType</code>) and the data itself as a binary
    string.</p><p>As a final test of the completed program, try dragging from this
    window to some drop-enabled window (as described earlier). Now, when you
    release the left mouse button to complete the "drop", the drop site should
    change its color to red.</p><p>The complete program is listed below, and is included in the
    <code class="filename">examples</code> directory under the file
    name <code class="filename">dragsource.rb</code>.</p><pre class="programlisting">require 'rubygems'
