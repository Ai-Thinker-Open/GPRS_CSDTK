    the FOX include files and library in the standard <code class="filename">/usr/local/include/fox-1.6</code> and <code class="filename">/usr/local/lib</code> directories, respectively. You
    can override these locations by passing a few additional arguments to

    C++, for use with a Ruby that was also compiled using Visual C++.</p><p>This discussion assumes that you've built Ruby using the
    instructions and build files distributed with the standard Ruby source
    code. To review, you should have started by unpacking the source code
    tarball, changing into the top-level source code directory (e.g. <code class="filename">C:\ruby-1.8.4</code>) and then typing:</p><pre class="screen">C:\ruby-1.8.4&gt;<span><strong class="command">win32\configure</strong></span>
type 'nmake' to make ruby for mswin32.
C:\ruby-1.8.4&gt;<span><strong class="command">nmake</strong></span></pre><p>After the compilation finished, you installed Ruby somewhere by
    typing, e.g.,</p><pre class="screen">C:\ruby-1.8.4&gt;<span><strong class="command">nmake DESTDIR=C:\ruby install</strong></span></pre><p>Similarly, I'm assuming that you built the FOX library using the
    Developer Studio project files distributed with the standard FOX source
    code distribution.</p><p>Now you can configure the FXRuby build by typing:</p><pre class="screen">C:\FXRuby-1.6.0&gt;<span><strong class="command">ruby install.rb config --make-prog=nmake -- \
    --with-fox-include=C:\fox-1.6.3\include \
    --with-fox-lib=C:\fox-1.6.3\lib</strong></span></pre><p>Once the build has been configured, you can start the build by
    typing:</p><pre class="screen">C:\FXRuby-1.6.0&gt; <span><strong class="command">ruby install.rb setup</strong></span></pre><p>It will take quite awhile to build FXRuby, even on a fast machine,
    so this might be a good time to take a coffee break. Because Visual C++ is
    such a strict compiler (usually a good thing), you will probably run into
    a few problems with non-ANSI declarations in the Ruby header files. If you
    do run into problems during the compilation, just check the next section
    for a list of things that could go wrong, and workarounds for those
    problems. None of them are showstoppers and none require you to restart
    the compile from scratch (just type <span><strong class="command">ruby install.rb
    setup</strong></span> to pick up where you left off).</p><p>Once it's finished compiling, install FXRuby by typing:</p><pre class="screen">C:\FXRuby-1.6.0&gt; <span><strong class="command">ruby install.rb install</strong></span></pre><p>As a quick sanity check, to make sure that all is well, you should
    probably fire up <code class="filename">irb</code> and try to import FXRuby:</p><pre class="screen">C:\FXRuby-1.6.0&gt; <span><strong class="command">irb</strong></span>
irb(main):001:0&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>require 'fox16'</code></strong>
true
irb(main):002:0&gt;</pre><p>If the import failed (usually with a message along the lines of
    "Cannot load library"), check the list of things that can go wrong for
    known problems. If that still doesn't solve your problem, drop me an
    e-mail or ask around on the Ruby newsgroup or mailing list; it's quite
    likely that someone else has run into this problem too. Once you do have a

    several function prototypes in the older "K &amp; R" C style, where the
    function's argument list is not included; for example, the function
    <code class="function">rb_thread_wait_for()</code> takes a single argument of type
    <span class="type">struct timeval</span>, but its prototype in
    <code class="filename">intern.h</code> is:</p><pre class="programlisting">void rb_thread_wait_for();</pre><p>Because FXRuby is written in C++, and C++ requires strict ANSI
    C-style function prototypes, code that attempts to call one of these
    functions will fail to compile under some compilers. For example, the
    error message from gcc will look something like this:</p><pre class="screen">FXRbApp.cpp: In method `long int FXRbApp::onChoreThreads (FXObject *, unsigned int, void *)':
/usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/i686-linux/intern.h:172: too many arguments to function `void rb_thread_wait_for ()'
FXRbApp.cpp:100: at this point in file
make: *** [FXRbApp.o] Error 1</pre><p>while the error message from Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler looks
    something like this:</p><pre class="screen">FXRbApp.cpp(109): error C2660: 'rb_thread_wait_for' : function does not take 1 parameters
NMAKE : fatal error U1077: 'cl' : return code '0x2'
Stop.</pre><p>This problem with the Ruby header files has been corrected for Ruby
    versions 1.6.8 (and later), but if you're building for an older version of
    Ruby you can do one of two things to work around the problem:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>If you're using gcc version 2.95 or earlier, try modifying the
        compiler flags (<code class="constant">CFLAGS</code>) in the FXRuby
        <code class="filename">Makefile</code> to include the
        <code class="option">-fno-strict-prototype</code> option; this should instruct
        the compiler to allow these kinds of discrepancies. Unfortunately,
        this flag is not supported in more recent versions of gcc.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A more direct approach is to just fix the offending declarations
        in the Ruby include file(s), i.e. change the declaration for
        <code class="function">rb_thread_wait_for()</code> in
        <code class="filename">intern.h</code> to read:</p><pre class="programlisting">void rb_thread_wait_for(struct timeval);</pre><p>and change the declaration for <code class="function">rb_gc_mark()</code>
        in <code class="filename">intern.h</code> to read:</p><pre class="programlisting">void rb_gc_mark(VALUE);</pre></li></ul></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>"Virtual Memory Exhausted"</em></span></p><p>For FXRuby releases earlier than version 0.99.173 it was common for
    the compiler to run out of memory trying to compile
    <code class="filename">core_wrap.cpp</code>, with an error message like:</p><pre class="screen">core_wrap.cpp: In function 'void Init_core()':
core_wrap.cpp:108596: virtual memory exhausted</pre><p>This failure was due to the use of optimizations by the compiler;
    the FXRuby source code makes heavy use of C++ templates and some versions
    of gcc require a lot of memory to process these. Starting with FXRuby
    version 0.99.173, the <code class="filename">extconf.rb</code> script
    <span class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> disable compiler optimizations when it
    generates the FXRuby <code class="filename">Makefile</code>. If you suspect that
    it's not disabling optimizations (or can see this by watching the compile
    command lines), try modifying the compiler flags
    (<code class="constant">CFLAGS</code>) in the <code class="filename">Makefile</code> by hand
    to do so.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>"Cannot load library"</em></span></p><p>On Linux and other Unix systems that support shared libraries, FOX
    is typically installed as a shared library named
    <code class="filename">libFOX-1.4.so</code>. After all of the source files for
    FXRuby are compiled, the last step is to link all of the FXRuby object
    files together with the FOX library (and possibly other system libraries)
    to produce a new shared library, named <code class="filename">fox14.so</code>, that
    Ruby can import as an extension module.</p><p>There are a few things that can go wrong when you try to import this
    extension into Ruby. A common problem is that the operating system cannot
    locate the FOX shared library (<code class="filename">libFOX-1.4.so</code>) when it
    tries to dynamically load the FXRuby extension module; when this happens,
    the error message will look something like:</p><pre class="screen">$ <span><strong class="command">irb</strong></span>
irb(main):001:0&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>require 'fox'</code></strong>
LoadError: libFOX-0.99.so.173: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory - /usr/local/lib/ruby/1.6/i586-linux/fox.so
        from (irb):1:in 'require'
        from (irb):1
    </pre><p>One workaround for this problem is to modify the
    <code class="constant">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable to include the
    directory where <code class="filename">libFOX.so</code> is installed. For example,
    if <code class="filename">libFOX-1.4.so</code> is installed in <code class="filename">/usr/local/lib</code>, try setting:</p><pre class="screen">$ <span><strong class="command">export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib</strong></span>
$ <span><strong class="command">irb</strong></span>
irb(main):001:0&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>require 'fox'</code></strong>
</pre><p>If this works, you can of course permanently add the
    <code class="constant">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> setting to your login file(s) so that
    you don't have to remember to type it each time. Another approach that
    should work for Linux is to modify your
    <code class="filename">/etc/ld.so.conf</code> file to include the installation
    directory (e.g. <code class="filename">/usr/local/lib</code>). If you'd like to do
    this instead, you'll need to (as root):</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1" compact><li><p>Edit your <code class="filename">/etc/ld.so.conf</code> file and add the
        directory where <code class="filename">libFOX.so</code> is installed;
        and,</p></li><li><p>At the shell prompt, type <span><strong class="command">ldconfig</strong></span> to reload
        the linker configuration.</p></li></ol></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>"Undefined symbol..."</em></span></p><p>Another problem that has been reported by users of both Debian
    GNU/Linux and NetBSD 1.5 is an error message along the lines of:</p><pre class="screen">/usr/lib/libstdc++.so.2: Undefined symbol "__vt_9exception"...</pre><p>The fix for this problem is reported to be to modify the FXRuby
    <code class="filename">Makefile</code> and add <code class="option">-lgcc</code> to the
    <code class="constant">LIBS</code> line.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="goals.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="pt01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="gems.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">History and Goals&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="book.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Installing from Gems</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
