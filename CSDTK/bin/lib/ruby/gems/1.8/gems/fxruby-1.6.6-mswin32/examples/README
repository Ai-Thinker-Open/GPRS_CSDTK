This directory contains several example programs for FXRuby, and supporting
files for the same. Here is a partial list of the files you'll find here:

    button.rb
        Demonstrates the various layout and appearance options for the
        FXButton widget.

    dialog.rb
        Simple example demonstrating how to create both modal and non-modal
        dialogs.

    dirlist.rb
        Demonstrates the directory list (FXDirList) widget.

    foursplit.rb
        Demonstrates the 4-way splitter widget.

    gltest.rb
        Demonstrates the OpenGL canvas widget, and how to use both timers
        and chores in FOX applications. This one also requires the OpenGL
        extensions for Ruby; check the Ruby Application Archive for the
        current release.

    groupbox.rb
        This is a kind of periodic table of widgets for FOX; it displays
        a wide variety of the core widgets with different options.

    header.rb
        Demonstrates the header widget.

    hello.rb
        Minimalist FXRuby: the classic "Hello, World!" program

    hello2.rb
        The souped-up version of "Hello, World!", complete with a PNG icon
        and tooltips.

    imageviewer.rb
        This is primarily a demonstration of the image view (FXImageView)
        widget but it also provides a model for what could be a full-blown
        FXRuby application. This example has a menu bar and toolbar (both
        "floatable") and demonstrates how to use FOX's registry mechanism
        for persistent application settings.
        and tooltips.

    scribble.rb
        This is the Ruby version of the scribble program described in the
        standard FOX documentation. It demonstrates the basics of drawing
        into a 2-D canvas as well as FOX's GUI updating features.

    shutter.rb
        Demonstrates the shutter widget, similar to that found in a popular
        office application.
