  # The Icon Dictionary manages a collection of icons.  The icons are referenced
  # by their file name.  When first encountering a new file name, the icon is
  # located by searching the icon search path for the icon file.  If found, the
  # services of the icon source object are used to load the icon from the file.
  # A custom icon source may be installed to furnish support for additonal 
  # image file formats.
  # Once the icon is loaded, an association between the icon name and the icon
  # is entered into the icon dictionary.  Subsequent searches for an icon with
  # this name will be satisfied from the cached value.
  # The lifetype of the icons is managed by the icon dictionary, and thus all
  # icons will be deleted when the dictionary is deleted.
