== Description
   A package for playing with sound on Windows.

== Prerequisites
   This package requires Ruby 1.8.0 or later. Ruby 1.8.2 or later is
   recommended.

== Installation instructions
   rake test (optional)
   rake install (non-gem) or rake install_gem (gem)

== Synopsis
   require 'win32/sound'
   include Win32

   # Get the current volume of the waveform-audio output device.
   p Sound.volume.join(", ") # left channel, right channel

   # Play a system sound
   Sound.play("SystemAsterisk",Sound::ALIAS)

   # Play a wav file
   Sound.play("somefile.wav")

== Acknowledgements
   API ideas derived (or not) from Perl's Win32::Sound module and Python's
   winsound package.

== Known Bugs
   None that I'm aware of. Please report any bugs on the Win32 Utils home
   page at http://rubyforge.org/projects/win32utils.
   
== Questions and Comments
   Please post questions and/or comments on one of the forums on the project
   page at http://rubyforge.org/projects/win32utils. Click the 'Forums' tab.
	
== Future Plans
   Add ability to retrieve information about WAV files.
   Add MIDI support?

== Developer's Notes
   The MessageBeep() function, which the Python "winsound" module contains,
   is intentionally omitted here. I felt it was redundant, because you can
   achieve the same effect with something like
   Sound.play("SystemAsterisk", Sound::ALIAS).
