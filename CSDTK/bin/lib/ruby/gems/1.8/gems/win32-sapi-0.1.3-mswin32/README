== Description
This is an interface to the MS SAPI (Sound API) library.

== Prerequisites
The MS SAPI library, version 5.0 or later.  You can find out more at
http://www.microsoft.com/speech.  The download now seems to be available
at http://www.microsoft.com/downloads.  Just search for "sapi".

Ruby 1.8.0 or later, though I recommend 1.8.2 or later due to bug fixes
in the OLE library.

== Installation
=== Manual Installation
ruby test\tc_sapi5.rb (optional)
ruby install.rb

=== Gem Remote Installation
gem install win32-sapi

=== Gem Local Installation
ruby test\tc_sapi5.rb (optional)
ruby win32-sapi.gemspec
gem install win32-sapi-<version>-mswin32.gem

== Notes
This is a pure Ruby library that uses the Win32OLE package.

== Documentation
The SAPI documentation is far too extensive for me to inline here.  Please see
the documentation that came with the SAPI SDK download.
