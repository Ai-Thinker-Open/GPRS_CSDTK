== 1.2.3 - 4-Nov-2006
* Bug fix for file sizes over 4gb.

== 1.2.2 - 13-May-2006
* Yet another blksize bug fix.
* Minor tweak to the pretty_print method with regards to handling nil values.
* Bumped the minimum required windows-pr version to 0.4.0 in the gemspec.

== 1.2.1 - 12-May-2006
* Fixed a bug with regards to the block count where the constructor would die
  with a FloatDomainError if the blksize returned 0 or nil.  It now defaults
  to nil in that event.

== 1.2.0 - 23-Apr-2006
* Removed the attribute setters.  From now on this class provides readonly
  methods.  Use the win32-file package for attribute setters.
* Added the content_indexed? alias for the indexed? method.
* Corresponding test suite changes.
* Fixed the pp issue by writing a custom pretty_print method.

== 1.1.0 - 15-Apr-2006
* Added the chardev?, dev_major, dev_minor directory?, file?, executable?,
  executable_real?, ftype, grpowned?, owned?, pipe?, readable?, readable_real?,
  rdev_major, rdev_minor, setgid?, setuid?, size?, socket?, sticky?, symlink?,
  writable?, writable_real? and zero? methods.  Note that not all of these
  methods return meaningful values and were merely added to match the current
  spec.  See documentation for details.
* Added a VERSION constant.
* Some optimization in the constructor.
