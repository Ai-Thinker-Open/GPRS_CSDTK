= Differences between Ruby's File::Stat and this version:
* The File::Stat#blksize method returns a meaningful value.
* The File::Stat#blockdev method works more accurately.
* The File::Stat#blocks method returns a meaningful value.
* The File::Stat#dev method returns a drive letter, not a number.
* The File::Stat#executable? method works properly.
* The File::Stat#executable_real? returns the same value as
  File::Stat#executable? (which now works properly).
* The File::Stat#file? method works properly.
* The File::Stat#ftype method works more accurately.
* The File::Stat#pipe method works properly.
* The File::Stat#size method handles file sizes greater than 2 gigabytes
  correctly.
* The File::Stat#socket method works more accurately.
* Allows you to get file attributes specific to MS Windows, e.g. archive,
  hidden, etc.
* The pp (pretty print) output has been customized.
  
= Known issues or bugs
None that I'm aware of. Please report any bugs you find on the project page
at http://www.rubyforge.org/projects/win32utils.

= Miscellaneous
I had to require 'pp' explicitly in order to deal with the fact that pp.rb
has a builtin pretty_print method for File::Stat.  If I didn't do this
you would end up using the pretty_print in pp.rb, which would break.
