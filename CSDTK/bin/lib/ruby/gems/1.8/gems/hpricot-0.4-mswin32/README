Hpricot is a fast, flexible HTML parser written in C.  It's designed to be very
accomodating (like Tanaka Akira's HTree) and to have a very helpful library (like
some JavaScript libs -- JQuery, Prototype -- give you.)

Right now, there's not much here.  The scanner works, but I'm still writing all
the support libraries.
