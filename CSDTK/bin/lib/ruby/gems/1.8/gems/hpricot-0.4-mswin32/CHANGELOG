* The :fixup_tags option will try to sort out the hierarchy so elements end up with the right parents.
* Elements such as *script* and *style* (identified as having CDATA contents) receive a single text node as their children now.  Previously, Hpricot was parsing out tags found in scripts.
* Better scanning of partially quoted attributes (found by Brent Beardsly on http://uswebgen.com/)
* Better scanning of unquoted attributes -- thanks to Aaron Patterson for the test cases!
* Some tags were being output in the empty tag style, although browsers hated that.  FIXED!
* Added Elements#at for finding single elements.
* Added Elem::Trav#[] and Elem::Trav#[]= for reading and writing attributes.

* Fixed negative string size error on empty tokens. (news.bbc.co.uk)
* Allow the parser to accept just text nodes. (such as: <tt>Hpricot.parse('TEXT')</tt>)
* from JQuery to Hpricot::Elements: remove, empty, append, prepend, before, after, wrap, set, 
  html(...), to_html, to_s. 
* on containers: to_html, replace_child, insert_before, insert_after, innerHTML=.
* Hpricot(...) is an alias for parse.
* open up all properties to setters, let people do as they may. 
* use to_html for the full html of a node or set of elements.
* doctypes were messed.

* Rewrote the HTree parser to be simpler, more adequate for the common man.  Will add encoding back in later.

* For whatever reason, wrote this HTML parser in C.
  I guess Ragel is addictive and I want to improve HTree.
