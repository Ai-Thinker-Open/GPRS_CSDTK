== Description
   A package for playing with sound on Windows.

== Prerequisites
   This package requires Ruby 1.8.0 or later.

== Installation instructions
=== Gem installation
   ruby win32-sound.gemspect
   gem install win32-sound-X.X.X.gem

=== Manual installation
   ruby install.rb
   ri lib\win32\sound.rb (to generate documentation)

== Synopsis
   require "win32/sound"
   include Win32
	
   # Get the current volume of the waveform-audio output device.
   p Sound.volume.join(", ") # left channel, right channel
	
   # Play a system sound
   Sound.play("SystemAsterisk",Sound::ALIAS)
	
   # Play a wav file
   Sound.play("somefile.wav")

== Acknowledgements
   API ideas derived (or not) from Perl's Win32::Sound module and Python's
   winsound package.
	
== Known Bugs
   None that I'm aware of.  Please report any bugs on the Win32 Utils home
   page at http://rubyforge.org/projects/win32utils.
   
== Questions and Comments
   Please post questions and/or comments on one of the forums on the project
   page at http://rubyforge.org/projects/win32utils.  Click the 'Forums' tab.
	
== Future Plans
   Add ability to retrieve information about WAV files.
   Add MIDI support?
	
== Developer's Notes
   The MessageBeep() function, which the Python "winsound" module contains,
   is intentionally omitted here.  I felt it was redundant, because you can
   achieve the same effect with something like
   Sound.play("SystemAsterisk", Sound::ALIAS).
