= 0.4.3 - 18-Dec-2006
* Removed the FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_SYSTEM flag to the FormatMessage function
  in the get_description private method because it could sometimes return
  bogus information.  Thanks go to Greg Holmes for the spot.
* Added the string_inserts member to the EventLogStruct.  This contains an
  array of only the raw string inserts, rather than the entire text message.

= 0.4.2 - 6-Aug-2006
* Fixed a bug in the EventLog.read method related to the
  EVENTLOG_BACKWARDS_READ flag.
* Fixed a bug in the EventLog.read method where the event_type was not being
  set properly.  Thanks go to "TheR" for the spot and the fix.
* Fixed bugs in the EventLog#tail method where it would fail if the log was
  full and dups would appear.

= 0.4.1 - 28-May-2006
* Fixed a bug in the EventLog#notify_change method where the handle would
  die after five or six reads.  Thanks go to botp for the spot.

= 0.4.0 - 24-May-2006
* Now pure Ruby.
* Now includes a gemspec.
* Fixed a major bug the EventLog#tail method where it was reading the log in
  the wrong order (!!!).
* Fixed a bug in the EventLog#report_event with regards to long category_id's.
  Actually, this wasn't so much "fixed" as "avoided" by virtue of using a
  pure Ruby solution.
* Added the EventLog#full? method.
* Documentation updates and corrections, including the tutorial on creating
  and writing to your own event source.
  
== 0.3.3 - 2-Jan-2006
* If EventLog.new fails, it now raises EventLogError instead of StandardError.
* Added documentation to the eventlog.txt file for EventLog#notify_change.
* Added inline rdoc to the C source code.
* Code cleanup.

== 0.3.2 - 26-May-2005
* Code now more Unicode friendly, and other cleanup.
* Made the .txt files rdoc friendly, and removed the .rd files.
* Minor adjustments to the test suite.

== 0.3.1 - 16-Feb-2005
* Minor modifications to the source to eliminate some warnings that appeared
  in Ruby 1.8.2 or later, plus other minor tweaks.
* Renamed the sample programs and moved the 'examples' directory to the
  toplevel directory.
* Made this document rdoc friendly.

== 0.3.0 - 30-Oct-2004
* Added the notify_change() and tail() methods.
* Added the write() alias for report_event().
* The read() class and instance methods now return an array of structs if
  no block is given.
* Added the 'rubymsg.mc' message category file.  If installed, this will
  create a 'RubyMsg' event source for use with win32-service, though you
  may use it for whatever you wish.  See the README for more details. 
* Renamed struct back to EventLogStruct - sorry, sorry - I promise I won't
  change this again.
* Fixed a bug where using EventLog::SEEK_READ did not work properly (thanks
  Park).
* Added the notify.rb test script under doc/examples.

== 0.2.5 - 28-Oct-2004
* Modified the open() and read() class methods to default to "Application"
  for the default Event source.
* Removed the .html files.  You can generate these on your own with rd2.

== 0.2.4 - 19-Oct-2004
* Fixed a bug where a segfault would result if an Event Log entry were
  somehow corrupted.  Thanks go again to Joey Gibson for the spot.
* Very minor doc corrections in tutorial.txt and eventlog.txt

== 0.2.3 - 14-Oct-2004
* Fixed a bug where some Event Log descriptions were returning nil instead
  of the actual description.  Thanks go to Joey Gibson for the spot.
* Minor test suite and doc additions, including a "future plan" that may
  be of interest.

== 0.2.2 - 02-Jul-2004
* Fixed a bug in the read() method where not all the records were being
  returned.
* Fixed calls to rb_time_new() - second argument appears to be mandatory as
  of 1.8.2.
* Renamed struct returned by read() to "EventLog".
* Changed struct members "id" and "type" to "event_id" and "event_type",
  respectively.  This was to avoid any confusion with the builtin Ruby
  methods of the same name.
* Replaced STR2CSTR() with StringValuePtr(), as the former is deprecated.
  This means that as of this version, Ruby 1.8.0 or later is required.
* Moved the sample programs to doc/examples.

== 0.2.1 - 04-Mar-2004
* The add_event_source() and report_event() methods now accept symbols as
  well as do key validation.
* Moved the EventLogError class under the Win32 module.
* Normalized the tc_eventlog.rb and tc_mc.rb scripts by making it easier to
  run them standalone from another directory.
* Minor modification to the build process.
* Added a test_write.rb script for general futzing when it comes to creating
  and writing events to the log.
* Doc updates, warranty information added.

== 0.2.0 - 1-Feb-2004
* Changed the Win32EventLogError class to just EventLogError.  I felt the
  Win32 was redundant given that the class is already under the Win32 module.
* Fixed bug where bogus error messages were returned because I was calling
  GetLastError() too late.
* Fixed bug where error messages were getting cut off and/or garbled due to
  \r\n character.  (Thanks Park Heesob).
* Added open_backup class method.

== 0.1.4 - 16-Jan-2004
* Slightly better handling of the EventLog#close method.  Adopted from code
  previously submitted by Park Heesob.
* Fixed a bug in the (internal) GetUser() function that caused a segfault if
  there were 250+ records.  That function has been greatly simplified.
* Removed the rb_ensure() approach.  What I thought was a memory leak was not,
  in fact, a memory leak.  Also, it was slowing down the method considerably.
* Minor test suite update.

== 0.1.3 - 7-Jan-2004
* Fixed memory leaks in read() method (Park Heesob).
* Added read() class method (Daniel Berger).
* Test suite and doc additions & updates

== 0.1.2 - 30-Nov-2003
* Added the report_event method.  You can now write to the event log.
* Added the add_event_source class method, allowing you to register a custom
  event source.
* Added the win32-mc package to the distribution.  This is a simple
  wrapper to generate .dll files from .mc files.
* Added Event Type constants
* Test suite additions
* Documentation updates and additions, including a small tutorial.

== 0.1.1 - 5-Nov-2003
* Fixed the free() call, and added implicit eventlog closing (when the
  EventLog object is free'd).
* Simplified constants by removing 'EVENTLOG_' portion of name.
* Cleanup in the GetDescription() method, which was causing segfaults in
  conjunction with TestUnit.
* Minor doc updates and cleanup.

== 0.1.0 - 14-Oct-2003
* Initial release
