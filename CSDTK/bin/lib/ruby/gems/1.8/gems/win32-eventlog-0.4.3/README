= What is it?
An interface to the Windows Event Log.

= Prerequisites
Ruby 1.8.2 or later.
windows-pr 0.5.0 or later.

= Installation
== Manual install
ruby test\tc_eventlog.rb (optional)
ruby install.rb
== Gem Install
ruby win32-eventlog.gemspec
gem install win32-eventlog-X.Y.Z-mswin32.gem

This will install both the win32-eventlog and win32-mc packages.  The latter
is strictly for turning .mc files into .dll files.  See the mc documentation
for more details.

= Installing the 'RubyMsg' event source
If you wish to install the RubyMsg event source, run the 'install_msg.rb'
script in the 'misc' directory.  This will create a 'rubymsg' directory under
your toplevel Ruby installation directory (usually C:\ruby), and create the
.dll, .h, .rc and .res files there, in addition to copying the rubymsg.mc file.
It will then install the 'RubyMsg' event source into your registry.

DO NOT MOVE THE DLL FILE ONCE IT IS INSTALLED!  If you do, you will have
to delete the registry entry and reinstall it with the correct path.

Take a look at the rubymsg.mc file for the category and message values.  If
you do not understand this, please read the 'tutorial.txt' file in the 'doc'
directory.

= Additional documentation
If you are unfamiliar with message files and event logging on Windows in
general, please read the 'tutorial.txt' file.

There are also a couple of sample test scripts under the 'examples'
directory if you want to futz around and get a feel for how things work.

= If the tc_mc.rb tests fail
There's a chance that you either don't have the mc, rc and/or link commands
installed or they're not in your %PATH%.  If you have MSVC++, you should have
them somewhere on your system.

= Known Issues
The code currently only checks the EventMessage file, it does not check the
CategoryMessage or ParameterMessage files.
