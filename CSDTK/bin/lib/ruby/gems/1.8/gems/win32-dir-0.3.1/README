= Description
   A series of extra constants for the Dir class that define special folders
   on Win32 systems, , as well as methods for creating and detecting junctions
   (i.e. symlinks for directories).

= Installation
== Manual
   ruby test\tc_dir.rb (optional)
   ruby install.rb
== Gems
   ruby win32-dir.gemspec
   gem install win32-dir-X.Y.Z-mswin32.gem

= Notes
   Some tests may fail.  That is expected, because not all constants are
   necessarily defined on your system.

= Synopsis
   require "win32/dir"
	
   # C:\WINNT or C:\WINDOWS
   puts Dir::WINDOWS

   # C:\Documents and Settings\Daniel\Start Menu\Programs\Administrative Tools	 
   puts Dir::ADMINTOOLS
	
   Dir.mkdir('C:\from')
   Dir.create_junction('C:\to', 'C:\from')

= Constants
   Not all of these are guaranteed to be defined on your system.  Also note
   that the directories are merely defined.  It doesn't necessarily mean they
   actually exist.

== Developer's Notes
   The SHGetFolderPath() documentation on MSDN is somewhat vague about which
   CSIDL constants are guaranteed to be defined.  However, there are 15 which
   *should* be defined (see docs above).  The rest I cannot vouch for.  On
   my own Windows XP SP 2 system, all but 7 were defined.
	
== Known Bugs
   The Unicode support is not quite there for Dir.create_junction.  It creates
   the directory and junction fine, but the +to+ name appears to get garbled
   with regards to the character set.
	
   Please log any other bug reports on the RubyForge project page at
   http://www.rubyforge.net/projects/win32utils.

== Future Plans
   Fix the Unicode issue with Dir.create_junction.
   Other suggestions welcome.

== Acknowledgements
   Shashank Date and Zach Dennis for the suggestion and supporting comments
   on the mailing list.
	
   Timothy Byrd and Autrijus Tang for help (directly or indirectly) with the
   junction methods.  Timothy provided a pure Ruby version of the junction
   code that I later borrowed from.
	
   Most of the documentation was copied from the MSDN web site.
