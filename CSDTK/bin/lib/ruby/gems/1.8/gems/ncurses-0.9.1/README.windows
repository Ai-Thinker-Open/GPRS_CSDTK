Ncurses has been ported to the cygwin environment.  If you are using the
cygwin version of ruby on windows, you can simply use this version of
ncurses.

Instead, if you are using a native windows version of Ruby (compiled with
mingw, visual c++, borland c++), then you can use this wrapper with the
PDCurses library (http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/). In this case,
ncurses-ruby wraps the subset of curses features that are common to ncurses
and PDCurses.

Here's how to compile ncurses-ruby on windows using PDCurses and MinGW:
(For those not familiar enough with the mingw compiler, you can get a
 precompiled mingw ruby from
 http://www.ruby-lang.org/~eban/ruby/binaries/mingw/, and a precompiled
 ncurses-ruby version from this project's download area
 http://developer.berlios.de/project/filelist.php?group_id=273)

- compile ruby with mingw 2.0 and install it somewhere. remember to set up
  the PATH environment correctly.

- get the sources for PDCurses and compile them using the provided Makefile
  "win32/mingwin32.mak"

- next, move the pdcurses header files ("curses.h", "panel.h") into mingw's
  include directory. Also, move the generated libraries ("pdcurses.a",
  "panel.a") into mingw's lib directory, while renaming these libraries to
  "libpdcurses.a" and "libpanel.a"

- compile and install ncurses-ruby using the commands "ruby extconf.rb",
  "make", "make install"

- try out the examples
