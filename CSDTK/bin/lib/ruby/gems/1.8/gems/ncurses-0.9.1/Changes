ncurses-ruby-0.9:
 * Forms wrapper contributed by Simon Kaczor
 * ncurses-ruby now also works with ncurses-4.2
   (an old release from 1998, needed for Zaurus-port)
 * First binary package for Sharp Zaurus (arm-linux)

ncurses-ruby-0.8:
 * Bugfix: Calls into the ncurses library prior to calling
   Ncurses::initscr or Ncurses::newterm had previously crashed
   the Ruby interpreter.
   Fixed by delaying the binding of most Ncurses functions
   until after Ncurses::initscr or Ncurses::newterm have been
   called.
 * Replaced module functions with singleton functions. This
   means that
     include Ncurses
     initscr
   is no longer possible. Instead, use
     Ncurses.initscr
   Reasons: - Consistency. The shortcut has never been possible
              with all ncurses functions.
            - Namespace pollution. Some ncurses functions have
              too common names.

ncurses-ruby-0.7.2:
 * reintroduced Ncurses::pechochar and Ncurses::redrawwin in the ncurses build.
   These had been removed by mistake because they did not work with PDCurses.
