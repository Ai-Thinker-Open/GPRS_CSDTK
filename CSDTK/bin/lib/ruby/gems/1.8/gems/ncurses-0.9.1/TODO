This is the complete list of functions present in ncurses that have not yet
been wrapped by ncurses-ruby:

terminfo functions: setupterm, setterm, set_curterm, del_curterm, restartterm,
                    tparm, tputs, vidputs

termcap fuctions:   tgetent, tgetflag, tgetnum, tgetstr, tgoto

ncurses
kernel functions:   ripoffline

No sense in
wrapping these:     vw_printw, vwprintw, vwscanw
