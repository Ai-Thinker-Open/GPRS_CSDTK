Ideally, an example program on how to use a library should be in the public
domain.

Some of the example programs contained in this dircectory have not been put in
the public domain, however.

The reason is because I did not write all programs completely myself -- I've
adapted the following example programs from ncurses programs in other
programming languages, or I have included example programs contributed by
other authors, and I have to respect their original licenses:
- rain.rb is adapted from rain.c from the ncurses library distribution.
- example.rb is adapted from an example program for the python ncurses binding.
- tclock.rb is adapted from tclock.c from the ncurses library distribution.
- form.rb anf form2.rb have been written by Simon Kaczor, who has adapted them
  from sample code from the NCurses Programming HOWTO.

See the comments in the source files for restrictions imposed on copying and
modifying these.

That said, I suppose you may still look at their source code and learn how
ncurses programs generally work, as long as you dont start your own programs
by loading the example program into your editor and modify it to your needs.
