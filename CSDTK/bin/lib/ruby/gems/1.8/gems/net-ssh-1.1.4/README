= Net::SSH

<b><em>A pure Ruby module that emulates an SSH client.</em></b>

<em>Author: Jamis Buck (jamis@37signals.com)</em>

Net::SSH absolutely WILL NOT work with the version of Ruby's OpenSSL module currently shipped with Ruby versions < 1.8.2 final. If you insist on trying it with a pre-1.8.2 final version, you must get a patched version of the OpenSSL module and install it (and remove the old module) before using Net::SSH.

The current release of Net::SSH supports:

* the execution of processes on the remote host (interactively, or non-interactively)
* interacting with a user's shell
* port forwarding, both from a local port to a remote port, and vice versa
* HTTP and SOCKS proxy support (and support for creation of additional proxy types)
