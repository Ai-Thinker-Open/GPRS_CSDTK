  * Fixed broken mkdir in host key verification.

  * Fixed problems with Windows users getting "address family for hostname
    not supported" errors.

[1.1.0] 1 May 2007

  * Server key verification (enabled by default, disable with :paranoid => false)

  * Add support for SSH agent forwwarding

[1.0.10] 9 Sep 2006
  * Experiment with using read instead of sysread, to try and alleviate problems
    on Windows.

  * Use printf instead of echo -n in the shell service, for compatibility with
    more unices.

  * Give a sane error message when the user name is nil and cannot be derived
    from the environment.

  * Add a #connection accessor to the session.

  * Add initial support for server-originated global requests.

[1.0.9] 14 Apr 2006
  * Fix a bug when used in tandem with edge Rails, due to monkeypatching in Rails.

    caught

[1.0.7] 27 Jan 2006
  * Fix intermittent "corrupt mac" bug (finally!)

[1.0.6] 19 Jan 2006
  * Send NEWKEYS message first, for compatibility with wodSSHServer (which
    won't send NEWKEYS until recieving it)

  * Do not print the banner message by default on authorization (rarely useful
    for automated processes anyway)

[1.0.5] 2 Jan 2006
  * Added connection.ping! and session.ping! for testing the connection

[1.0.4] 24 Dec 2005
  * Fixed tests broken by changes in Ruby 1.8.4.

  * Fixed references to obsolete contact email address.

[1.0.3] 9 Nov 2005
  * Fixed for windows so that connections succeed even if pageant process is
    not running.

[1.0.2] 26 Jul 2005
  * Fixed channel on_request callback signature.

  * Better thread-safety in the connection driver (fixes some "Bad packet size"
    errors in multi-threaded apps)

  * Corrected various minor bugs.

[1.0.1] 17 Jun 2005
  * Added a :timeout option on the transport session

  * Net::SSH works with the Putty Agent now

[1.0.0] 6 Feb 2005
  * Password can be programmatically specified for the 'keyboard-authentication'
    method.
  
  * All unit tests pass on Windows now.

  * Channels now respect their own local window and maximum packet sizes, and
    report reasonable values to the server. This fixes a bug that caused
    problems when large quantities of data were requested of the server and
    certain server maximums were being exceeded.

  * Client name is determined in a more robust manner.

  * Fixed hostbased bug.

  * Authentication process is now aware of the authentication methods reported
    by the server as having a chance of succeeded, and no longer attempts
    those methods that cannot possibly succeed.

[0.9.0] 11 Jan 2005
  * Added 'shell' and 'sync' services for interacting with users' shells,
    including a demo script that uses these to implement a simple SSH terminal
    client.

  * The 'keyboard-interactive' authentication method is implemented correctly
    now, which means users will receive a prompt to enter a password if one is
    not given, and is required.

  * The bug that caused the agent to always be used--even if it was
    unavailable--has been fixed.

  * The user manual now includes links to previous/next chapters, and uses
    syntax highlighting for the code blocks. Various other style tweaks in the
    manual.

  * Window sizes and maximum packet sizes are now honored, which should take
    care of various bugs and make Net::SSH play nicer with older SSH servers.

  * Non-blocking reads are now supported via the
    Transport::Session#reader_ready? method. The Connection::Driver#process
    method has been modified to make better use of this.

  * Moved to subversion, from CVS. Repository is now at
    http://www.jamisbuck.org/svn/net-ssh

[0.6.0] 2 Dec 2004
  * Added pageant support (thanks to Guillaume Marçais)

  * Added support for external services (like SFTP).

  * Use USERNAME environment variable if USER is not set (like on Windows)

[0.5.0] 23 Nov 2004
  * Refactored to use Needle.

  * Moved SFTP support into its own library.

  * Moved command-line utilities into their own library.
